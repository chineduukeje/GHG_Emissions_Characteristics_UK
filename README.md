# GHG_Emissions_Characteristics_UK
This study creates a method of putting the efforts of the government and other stakeholders in context with respect to the net-zero 2050 goal. Most analysis in this problem domain produces chart that are difficult for the average man on the street to understand. This project, on the other hand, performs a region and sectors-wise analysis of the United Kingdom and projects the contributions of each of this region and sector to greenhouse gas emission and how these impacts on climate change. This research analyses greenhouse gas emission data of the United Kingdom using data analysis and visualization tools with the goal of creating a predictive model that is capable of forecasting future emissions based on past and present data. The difference of this research with other works is the creation of a forecasting tool that is available and can be understood by all stakeholders. Figure 3.1 presents the methodology for executing this project.
